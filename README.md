# 42_libft
Codam assignment to create and write first static library

The object of this assignment was to recreate some of C's standard functions for use in our
future programming, since we are not allowed to use any of C's existing functions outside of
exit, malloc, free, write and read (with some exceptions).

The full assignment can be found here:\

There was also room to add some functions of your own volition.
